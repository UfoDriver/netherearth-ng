# Neither Earth remake

## TODO

* Better in-game menu navigation
  * It's too fast sometimes
  * It would be good to have shortcuts

* Guile integration?
* Robot health bar above (only players?)
* Consider using engine like irrlicht
* ~~No global hardcoded paths~~
* Crash on drawing explosions
* Compiler warnings
* Debugging (with command line option)
* Menu is broken after load (at least in combat mode)
* Make radar semitransparent
* Provide bigger screen resolutions
