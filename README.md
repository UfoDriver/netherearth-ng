# Neither Earth remake

## TODO

* Better in-game menu navigation
  * ~~It's too fast sometimes~~
  * It would be good to have shortcuts

* Consider using engine like irrlicht
* ~~No global hardcoded paths~~
* ~~Crash on drawing explosions~~
* ~~Compiler warnings~~
* Debugging (with command line option)
* ~~Menu is broken after load (at least in combat mode)~~
* ~~Menu flickering when load/save screen present~~
* ~~Provide bigger screen resolutions~~
* ~~"NETHER" is a God object and should be decoupled~~
* ~~Fix collision detection~~
* ~~Fix ship to robot attachment~~
* Buildings should be built from blocks as block is not equal to bulding


## TODO for NG version

* Guile integration?
* Robot health bar above (only players'?)
* Robot program above (only players? with program arguments?)
* Factory/warbase capturing progress bar
* Make radar semitransparent (not sure if we need it when we have zoom)
* Support more than 2 players


~~Connecting to a warbase leads to segfault~~
~~No robots are spawn~~
~~Factory signs and flags are shifted~~
~~Chances that capture points are broken~~
~~No sound~~
~~Firing breaks the game~~


Correct warbase positions in map files
Correct factory positions in map files

Quiting the game leads to segfault (double free or corruption)
Game speed seems too high
