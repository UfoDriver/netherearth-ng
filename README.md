# Neither Earth remake

## TODO

* Better in-game menu navigation
  * It's too fast sometimes
  * It would be good to have shortcuts

* Guile integration?
* Consider using engine like irrlicht
* ~~No global hardcoded paths~~
* Crash on fire (probably when enemy in sight)
* Compiler warnings
* Debugging (with command line option)
